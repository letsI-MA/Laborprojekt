# This is a Mandelbrot Set Explorer

The idea was to display the __Mandelbrot Set__ in a somewhat appealing manner.
***This project is for me to learn and adapt to problems in software development.***
I did extensive amounts of comments in Version 1 so I can learn and keep the information close by.
At the bottom of this readme I will provide my sources.

### What is a Mandelbrot Set?

The Mandelbrot set is a collection of complex numbers ***c*** for which the sequence generated by the formula:

![formel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c48461e7-eed7-414c-975a-e434a08384fe) 

remains bounded as ***n→∞***.

- Start with ***z<sub>0</sub>*** = ***0***
- Add the constant ***c*** to the square of the current value of ***z***
- Repeat the process to see whether the value of ***z*** stays small _(bounded)_ or grows without limit _(diverges)_

### Visualizing the Mandelbrot Set

- Define a grid of points in the complex plane (real and imaginary numbers)
- For each point ***c***, iterate the formula up to a maximum number of steps
- Check if the magnitude ***z<sub>n</sub>*** remains ***≤2***. If so, c is part of the Mandelbrot set

The first Version was just a PoC on matplotlib:

In Version 2 I implemented the code into pygame and added these features:

- multiple color schemes, including the style wikipedia uses
- able to switch color schemes on button presses 1-6
- Zoom feature by dragging a square box over the set

With the help of ChatGPT I've switched to vector-based rendering, which enhanced the average FPS from 1.2 to 60 in 500x500 resolution 🙌.

## How ChatGPT did it

```
def brot_set(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, width, height, max_iter):
    x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, width)
    y = np.linspace(ymin, ymax, height)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)
    C = X + 1j * Y
```
It uses NumPy as np `meshgrid` to to process the list in its entirety instead of each `(x, y)` pixel individually.

```
color_array = np.zeros((height, width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)
for i in range(height):
    color_array[i] = [get_color(val, max_iter) for val in mandelbrot_set[i]]
pg.surfarray.blit_array(mandelbrot_surface, color_array)
```
Here it generates an array of colors in one step and creates a surface from the `color_array` afterwards.
The 2D `color_array` stores the RGB color values for each pixel.



## Controls

- Numberkeys 1-6 switches between colorschemes
- ESC closes the window and kills the process
- Left-Mouse-Button to draw a square in which to zoom in
- FPS counter in the top left corner
